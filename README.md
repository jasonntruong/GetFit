# Get Fit

BeReal for the gym. The user enters their gym schedule for the week and during their workout, they get a notification to take a picture within 2 minutes. They get to retake the pic until the app sees a dumbbell. If it does, you pass - great job. If it doesn't after 2 min you get charged $2 for skipping the gym.
